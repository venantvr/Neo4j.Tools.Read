# Neo4j.Tools.Read (Neo4j to Object model...)

Goal : to be able to read a complex graph of entities from a Neo4j database by matching objects with nodes, and navigation properties with relations. This project is based on the official *Neo4jClient* API and the *Neo4jClient.Extension* extension library. This library allows to retrieve, with a fluent syntax, an object model from a Neo4j database.
